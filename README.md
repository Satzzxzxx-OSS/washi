# Washi（和紙）

A lightweight viewer for reading Markdown, Typst, LaTeX, Mermaid and PDF quietly, re-rendering every time you save.
It opens as a reader. When you want to change something, press `⌘E` for an editor with a live preview beside it, or keep using your favorite editor: Washi redraws either way.

## Install

Apple Silicon macOS, with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh):

```sh
brew install --cask kiwamizamurai/tap/washi
brew upgrade --cask washi     # update
```

- This also puts the `washi` command on your PATH and installs `tectonic` for LaTeX (`latexmk` is used instead if you have it). Washi bundles no LaTeX engine.
- Homebrew trusts the tap for the fully qualified name above. To install by short name, run `brew trust --cask kiwamizamurai/tap/washi` first.
- Washi is not signed or notarized (ad-hoc signature), so the Cask removes the quarantine attribute that Homebrew adds.
- Without Homebrew: download `Washi-<version>-aarch64.zip` from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/kiwamizamurai/washi/releases), unzip it into `/Applications`, then allow it once under System Settings → Privacy & Security → Open Anyway.
- To build from source: see Development below.

## Usage

- **Open**: drop a file on the window, `⌘O`, Finder's "Open With", or `washi a.md b.typ` (one window per file).
- **Recent files**: the start screen lists the files you opened last.
- **Paste**: copy text and press `⌘V`; Markdown, Typst, LaTeX or Mermaid is detected from the content.
- **Edit**: press `⌘E` to split the window, with the source on the left and the preview on the right, updating as you type. `⌘E` again returns to reading. See [Editing](#editing).
- **Save to refresh**: save the open file, or any file it includes (LaTeX `\input` and `.bib`, Typst `#include`, Markdown images, even in subfolders), and it re-renders in place, keeping your scroll position.

| Action | Shortcut |
|---|---|
| Open / Reload / Print | `⌘O` / `⌘R` / `⌘P` |
| Command palette | `⌘K` (commands, recent files, `#` for headings) |
| Edit (split view) / Save | `⌘E` / `⌘S` |
| Find (and replace, while editing) | `⌘F` (`Enter` next, `⇧Enter` previous, `Esc` close; shows "3 / 12") |
| Toggle the outline | `⇧⌘O` |
| Zoom in / out / actual size | `⌘+` / `⌘-` / `⌘0` (`⌘` + wheel and pinch also work) |
| Jump to source | `⌘`-click a Typst / LaTeX PDF (or Markdown, while editing) |
| Theme, text width | "View" menu |

**Jump to source** opens the matching line in `code`, `cursor`, `zed`, `subl` or `mate` (first one found; otherwise the default text editor). Set `WASHI_EDITOR` to choose, for example `WASHI_EDITOR="code -g {file}:{line}:{column}"`.

## Editing

Washi always opens a file for reading. Press `⌘E` to edit Markdown, Typst, LaTeX or Mermaid (not PDF): the window splits into the source and the live preview. The editor is loaded only then, so reading stays light.

- **Live preview**: the preview renders your unsaved text as you type. Relative images, `#include` and `\input` keep working. LaTeX is slower, so it re-renders about a second after you stop typing, and on save.
- **Editor**: syntax highlighting, line numbers, undo and redo, search and replace (`⌘F`), and for Typst, completion and error squiggles. When the text does not compile, the last good preview stays on screen and the error shows in the status bar. The status bar also shows saved or unsaved, the character count, and error and warning counts: click one to jump to the next problem. Returning to reading with `⌘E` and back keeps your undo history.
- **Saving**: `⌘S` saves, and `●` in the title marks unsaved changes. Closing the window or quitting asks first. Autosave (after a second of idle) is off by default; File → "Toggle autosave" switches it on. If the file changes on disk while you have unsaved edits, Washi shows a banner and lets you keep your version or load the disk's. It never overwrites silently.
- **Source and preview follow each other**: `⌘`-click the preview to move the cursor to that source line, and the preview scrolls to the line your cursor is on (View → "Show the cursor line in the preview" turns this off). Drag the divider to resize the panes.

## Supported formats

| Format | Rendered as | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Markdown | HTML | GFM, footnotes, math (KaTeX), Mermaid, syntax highlighting, alerts, front matter, relative images and links |
| Typst | PDF | Built-in compiler; `@preview` packages are fetched on first use; errors show line and column |
| LaTeX | PDF | `latexmk`, or `tectonic` if missing; stops after 300 s (`WASHI_COMPILE_TIMEOUT` changes it) |
| Mermaid | SVG | `.mmd` / `.mermaid`; click a diagram to enlarge it |
| PDF | PDF | Text selection, search, bookmarks |

## For AI agents

`washi <file>` opens a file and **returns immediately**, so agent commands are never blocked.

```sh
washi plan.md --json                  # {"format_version":1,"launched":true,"files":[{"path":"/abs/plan.md","format":"markdown"}]}
washi plan.md --no-launch --json      # validate only
cat draft.md | washi - --name draft   # open stdin; the same --name updates the open window
washi formats --json                  # supported formats and the tools Washi found
```

- **Streams**: success prints one JSON line on stdout and nothing on stderr. Failure prints one JSON line on stderr, `{"format_version":1,"errors":[{"kind":...,"message":...,"path"?:...}]}`, and nothing on stdout.
- **Exit codes**: `0` success, `1` the app could not be launched (`launch_failed`), `2` anything else. Only `0` means success.
- **`kind`**: `usage`, `not_found`, `is_directory`, `unsupported_format`, `stdin_empty`, `stdin_unreadable`, `io`, `launch_failed`. `files[].format` is one of `markdown`, `mermaid`, `typst`, `latex`, `pdf`.
- **Compatibility**: within 1.x keys are only added, never removed, renamed or retyped, so ignore keys you do not know. A breaking change raises `format_version` and is announced in the [changelog](CHANGELOG.md).

## Comparison with other apps

Apps for only some of the formats: [TeXlyre](https://github.com/TeXlyre/texlyre) (Typst and LaTeX, web), [Moraya](https://github.com/zouwei/moraya) (Markdown and Typst), [SuperGoodViewer](https://github.com/dotsg/SuperGoodViewer) (Markdown only), [Osh](https://github.com/Hyp4tia/Osh) (Quick Look), [Presto](https://github.com/Presto-io/Presto) (Markdown → Typst → PDF).

To **write** full-time, use Oleafly, Texpile, hibi or Quire Writer. To **read**, and fix things as you go, use Washi: in what I checked, it and Typeset Viewer are the only apps that re-render all three formats when the file is saved from elsewhere. Typeset Viewer adds notes, review and presentation mode but is closed source, Apple Silicon only and has no editor; Washi is MIT, renders Mermaid, has a CLI and an editor you open only when you want it.

## Development

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm tauri dev          # run (open a file: pnpm tauri dev -- -- --gui examples/showcase.md)
pnpm test               # frontend tests
cargo test --workspace  # Rust tests (cargo test -p washi-core skips Tauri and is fast)
pnpm release            # release build of the .app
```

Rendering and the CLI live in `crates/washi-core` (no Tauri dependency); the app is `src-tauri` plus `src` (TypeScript). To add a format, implement `Renderer` in `crates/washi-core/src/render/`, add it to `RENDERERS` in `render/mod.rs`, and add its extensions to `fileAssociations` in `src-tauri/tauri.conf.json`. Publishing a GitHub Release (`gh release create v0.1.0 --generate-notes`) runs `.github/workflows/release.yml`: it builds the `.app` for that tag, attaches it to the release, and updates the Homebrew tap. CI (`ci.yml`) runs only when started by hand.
